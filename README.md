# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - Comprehensive Notes

This repository contains **handwritten notes** covering **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in depth, based on a complete walkthrough of concepts, architecture, and practical applications.

## 📌 Overview
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating an **external knowledge retrieval step** before generation.  
This approach helps LLMs produce **more accurate, up-to-date, and context-aware answers**.

These notes summarize:
- Core concepts of RAG
- Architecture & workflow
- Retrieval techniques
- Industry applications
- Future enhancements

## 📖 Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to RAG**
   - Why LLMs alone are not enough
   - Challenges: Hallucinations, outdated knowledge
2. **RAG Architecture**
   - Retriever + Generator components
   - Query understanding and transformation
3. **Document Retrieval**
   - Dense retrieval (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate)
   - Sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25)
   - Hybrid retrieval strategies
4. **Embedding Models**
   - How embeddings represent text
   - Choosing the right embedding model
5. **Chunking & Preprocessing**
   - Why chunking is necessary
   - Optimal chunk size & overlap
6. **Vector Databases**
   - Indexing documents for efficient search
   - Example integrations with FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone
7. **Prompt Engineering in RAG**
   - Structuring prompts for retrieved context
   - Handling irrelevant or noisy data
8. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Precision, Recall, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)
   - Human evaluation
9. **Industry Applications**
   - Enterprise knowledge assistants
   - Domain-specific QA systems
   - Healthcare, finance, legal document search
10. **Future Work**
    - Multi-modal RAG (text + images + audio)
    - Real-time retrieval with streaming data
    - Fine-tuning retrieval and generation jointly
